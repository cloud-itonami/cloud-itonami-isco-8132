  plant scheduling/logistics coordination actor (itonami actor
  pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section; README's
  'Robotics premise' — a plant scheduling/logistics coordination robot
  performs crew scheduling, production-run/inventory/progress record
  logging and darkroom-chemical/film-stock supply-order coordination
  for a film/photo processing plant crew under this advisor/governor
  pair, which never dispatches hardware itself, never operates
  processing equipment itself, and never finalizes a processing-
  operation-execution decision or a chemical-safety-clearance
  decision, nor overrides a plant safety officer's judgment — those
  remain the plant safety officer's exclusive judgment). Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-8112's mineralplant.store (closest domain shape
  — plant scheduling/logistics coordination for a hazardous-material
  industrial-site crew).

  Domain:

    operator — a registered photographic products processing plant
               equipment operator (:operator-id, :name)
    plant    — a registered photographic products (film/photo)
               processing plant site
               {:plant-id :name :max-supply-cost number}.
               `:max-supply-cost` is an informational registered
               ceiling used only to decide whether a
               `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates to human
               sign-off (the governor never blocks a within-threshold
               order outright; it only decides commit vs. escalate).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged production-run/
               inventory/progress entry, a scheduled crew/shift
               operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
               darkroom-chemical/film-stock supply order) — written
               ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger   — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
